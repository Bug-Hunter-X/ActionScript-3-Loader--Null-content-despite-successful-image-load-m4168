This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in ActionScript 3 related to the Loader class.  The problem occurs when loading images where the visual representation appears correctly, but accessing properties like `width` and `height` on `loader.content` returns null.  This often stems from timing issues or asynchronous operations. The `bug.as` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.as` presents a robust solution that addresses the issue and prevents unexpected null results.
